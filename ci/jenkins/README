Jenkins Continuous Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Scripts in this directory are supposed to be called from Jenkins. The idea is to
put all build scripts under version control while Jenkins does not contain any
knowledge on how to build the packages.
These scripts, rely on environment variables set by Jenkins to control them.

Here is a list:
$BUILD_NUMBER    - a running number Jenkins increments for each build
$PACKAGE_TYPE    - which package should be built
                   Note: this is set as an environment variable in the
                         configuration of the individual build machines
                         of Jenkins.
$BUILD_TYPE      - what is going to be built?
                      release:      a releasable version of the packages
                      nightly:      a nightly snapshot of the packages
                      incremental:  an incremental version (not published)

Script to be called by Jenkins are:
build.sh       - build CVMFS's packages in a certain scenario (see $BUILD_TYPE)
install.sh     - installs just built packages on the build machines to
                 test if they are sane
quick_test.sh  - run some tests on the build (i.e. the unit test suite)
publish.sh     - publish the built packages
cleanup.sh     - remove left-overs from the build node to prepare it for
                 the next build run
